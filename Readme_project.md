## Project objective

**Analyze Mexican's doctors propensity to utilize technological tools to enhance their heath services by answering the following questions:**

#### Subproject a) [esesancr]

Is there a correlation between a doctor's age and both his/her perception about the attractiveness of telemedicine in the future and his/her willingness to adopt a technological tool to enable services such as telemedicine?

#### Subproject b) [cecyar]

What are the attributes that doctors value the most in a technological platform that enhances their services?

#### Subproject c) [Roberto919]

Is there a correlation between the willingness to use the platform and a payment they are willing to make?

#### Subproject d) [cecyar, esesancr, Roberto919]

Null Hypothesis to be challenged: at least 50% of the Mexican doctors that are offered a technological platform that supports their service would be willing to use it regularly or very regularly.
