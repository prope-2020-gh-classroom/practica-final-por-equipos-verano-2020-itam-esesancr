## Objectives

Analyze Mexican's doctors propensity to utilize technological tools to enhance their heath services by answering the following questions:

1. Null Hypothesis to be challenged: at least 50% of the Mexican doctors that are offered a technological platform that supports their service would be willing to use it regularly or very regularly.
2. Is there a correlation between a doctor's age and both his/her perception about the attractiveness of telemedicine in the future and his/her willingness to adopt a technological tool to enable services such as telemedicine?
3. What are the attributes that doctors value the most in a technological platform that enhances their services?
